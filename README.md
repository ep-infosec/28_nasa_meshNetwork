# meshNetwork

The Mesh Network Communication System is a peer-to-peer communication network architecture that enables communication between network nodes of various types.  The initial primary goal of the system was to enable communication between small formations of cubesats or other small satellites, but the basic mesh architecture is applicable to data exchange between network assets of any type.  The system has been flight tested on formations of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) and shown to provide low latency data throughput for dynamic flight environments.
